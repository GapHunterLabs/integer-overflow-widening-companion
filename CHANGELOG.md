# Integer-Overflow-on-Widening Companion Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A description page for the inspection in **Settings | Editor |
  Inspections**, which showed "Under construction".

### Changed

- The rating prompt's local counter keeps one-way fingerprints of findings
  instead of their file paths, and deletes the list that earlier versions
  kept.
- `PRIVACY.md` describes the values the plugin keeps in the IDE's local
  settings.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Review/star CTA now links to this plugin's own Marketplace
  reviews page instead of the vendor's generic plugin list.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Warning on an `int * int`/`int + int` expression assigned/passed
  directly to a `long`-typed destination with no widening cast on
  either operand -- CWE-190, Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
- Checks every real destination shape: variable initializer,
  assignment, method argument, and method return.
